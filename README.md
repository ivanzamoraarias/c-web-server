# c-server-docker

This project provides a Dockerized C server setup. It is designed to run a C-based server application inside a container, making deployment and management easier.

## Features

- Containerized C server for easy deployment
- Simple configuration and setup
- Supports SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system

### Building and Running

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/c-server-docker.git
    cd c-server-docker
    ```
2. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t c-server .
    ```
3. Run the container:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 443:443 c-server
    ```

## Adding Certificates

To enable SSL/TLS, you need to add your certificate and key files:

1. Place your certificate (`server.crt`) and private key (`server.key`) in the `certs/` directory.
2. Update the server configuration (if needed) to point to these files.
3. Rebuild the Docker image to include the certificates:
    ```bash
    docker build -t c-server .
    ```
4. Start the container as shown above.

**Note:** Make sure your certificate and key files are valid and match your domain/server requirements.
